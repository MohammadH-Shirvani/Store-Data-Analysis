# Data Analysis Project Based on the OSEMN Framework

## Project Overview
This project involves data analysis based on the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret) framework. The main goal is to demonstrate the entire data science process from data acquisition to interpretation of results. Also you can use it as a guidesheet for data analysis.

## OSEMN Framework
The OSEMN framework is a popular methodology in data science which stands for:
- **Obtain**: Collecting the data from various sources.
- **Scrub**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- **Explore**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- **Model**: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **iNterpret**: Interpreting the results and drawing conclusions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections:

1. **Data**: Contains the datasets used in the project.
2. **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the analysis and code.
